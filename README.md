# HoriseonRefactor
## Description
Horiseon, a marketing agency, wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their website is optimized for search engines. They have requested we refactor their code to ensure accessibility and clarify and simply their existing code base. 

## Problems
1. The client's codebase does not use semantic HTML elements, so the organization of the site is not immediatley apparent when reviewing its index.html file. 
2. The elements represented in the corresponding stylesheet do not progress in the same order as they are presented in the index.html file. 
3. Images within the index.html file do not include alt text attributes.
4. One link within the existing site is not active.
5. The site lacks a descriptive title.
