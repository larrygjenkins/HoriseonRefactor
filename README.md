# HoriseonRefactor
## Description
Horiseon, a marketing agency, wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their website is optimized for search engines. 

## Problems
1. The client's codebase does not use semantic HTML elements, so the organization of the site is not immediatley apparent when reviewing its index.html file. 
2. The elements represented in the corresponding stylesheet do not progress in the same order as they are presented in the index.html file. 
3. Images within the index.html file do not include alt text attributes.
